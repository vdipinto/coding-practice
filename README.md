# JavaScript Coding Practice

This repository contains my coding practice exercises from **Codility**, written in JavaScript.

## Structure

- Each file represents one exercise solution.
- Files are named after the problem, e.g. `findMissingNumber.js`.

## Goals

- Practice algorithmic problem solving.
- Improve coding interview readiness.
- Build a library of reference solutions.
